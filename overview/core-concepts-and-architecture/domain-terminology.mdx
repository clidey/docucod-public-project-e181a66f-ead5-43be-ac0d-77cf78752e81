# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the foundational vocabulary of GORM Hints empowers you to use its features effectively and communicate precision when optimizing SQL query generation. This page defines the key terms you will encounter while working with this extension and clarifies how these concepts map to both GORM's abstractions and the underlying SQL syntax.

---

## Essential Terms Defined

### Optimizer Hint
Optimizer hints are special directives embedded within SQL queries that guide the database query planner's decisions on how to execute a query. These hints influence aspects such as join order, execution strategy, or resource limits without changing the query results.

In GORM Hints, *Optimizer Hints* are represented by clauses injected directly after the SQL `SELECT` or `UPDATE` keywords, formatted like this:

```sql
SELECT /*+ hint_contents */ * FROM users
```

**Example:**
```go
DB.Clauses(hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100)")).Find(&User{})
// Produces: SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100) */ * FROM `users`
```

---

### Index Hint
Index hints instruct the database on which indexes to consider, use, or ignore during query execution. They provide fine-grained control over index selection, which can crucially improve performance by enabling or restricting access to specific indexes.

Types of index hints include `USE INDEX`, `FORCE INDEX`, and `IGNORE INDEX`. Additionally, they can be scoped for operations such as joins, ordering, or grouping.

Example representation in SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users USE INDEX (`user_name_idx`)
```

Using GORM Hints:

```go
DB.Clauses(hints.UseIndex("user_name_idx")).Find(&User{})
// Produces: SELECT * FROM `users` USE INDEX (`user_name_idx`)
```

Index hints can be further qualified:

```go
hints.ForceIndex("idx1", "idx2").ForJoin()
// Adds FORCE INDEX FOR JOIN (`idx1`, `idx2`)
```

---

### Comment Hint
Comment hints are standard SQL comments inserted before, after, or inside specific parts of a query to document, tag, or annotate the SQL for traceability, debugging, or runtime behavior awareness injected by middleware or proxy layers.

Unlike optimizer and index hints, comment hints are purely informational and do not influence execution plans.

You can control comment placement relative to clauses in the SQL query:

- Before a clause
- After a clause
- Inline within a clause

Example:

```go
DB.Clauses(hints.CommentBefore("select", "node2")).Find(&User{})
// Produces: /* node2 */ SELECT * FROM `users`

DB.Clauses(hints.CommentAfter("where", "filter applied")).Find(&User{}, "id = ?", 1)
// Produces: SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE id = ? /* filter applied */
```

---

### Clause
In GORM and SQL, a *clause* is a structural keyword or segment of a query such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, `UPDATE`, or `JOIN`. Clauses organize the query logically and determine its semantics.

GORM Hints associates optimizer, index, or comment hints with specific clauses to ensure hints appear at the correct location in the final SQL.

For example:

| Clause | Where hint appears |
|---------|--------------------|
| SELECT  | After `SELECT` keyword |
| UPDATE  | After `UPDATE` keyword |
| WHERE   | After the `WHERE` condition |
| INSERT  | Before `INSERT` statement |

This mapping allows precise control over where a hint or comment is injected.

---

### Relationship of Concepts in Query Generation

GORM Hints implements these concepts via `Clauses` that modify SQL building instructions precisely where and how hints appear:

- **Optimizer hints** use a special comment syntax starting with `/*+` immediately following `SELECT` or `UPDATE`.
- **Index hints** attach immediately after the table name in `FROM` or `UPDATE` clauses.
- **Comment hints** wrap arbitrary SQL comments placed before, after, or within clauses.

This separation maintains SQL correctness, while giving developers powerful tools to guide database behavior.

---

## Practical Understanding: How Concepts Work Together

When crafting a query, you often want to both *force a specific index* and *add an optimizer hint* alongside a *trace comment*. GORM Hints lets you chain these directives cleanly:

```go
DB.Clauses(
    hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100)"),
    hints.ForceIndex("idx_user_name").ForJoin(),
    hints.Comment("select", "trace=xyz")
).Find(&User{})
// Produces:
// SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100) */ * FROM `users` FORCE INDEX FOR JOIN (`idx_user_name`) /* trace=xyz */
```

Here:
- The optimizer hint guides the DB optimizer.
- The index hint controls index selection for joins.
- The comment adds an informational tag.

Each maps to a specific clause and position in the SQL.

---

## How This Fits Into GORM’s Query Builder

GORM’s query building flow composes SQL from multiple clauses, where each clause may have expressions, transformations, or modifiers.

The Hints extension inserts its custom expressions at the right injection points within these clauses during SQL generation.

**User-Centric Value:**

- Precise placement of hints avoids malformed SQL.
- Users gain fine control without altering their base GORM queries extensively.
- The ability to combine hints smoothly helps optimize complex queries.
