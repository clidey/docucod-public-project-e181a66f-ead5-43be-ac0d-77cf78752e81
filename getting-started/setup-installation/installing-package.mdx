# Installing GORM Hints

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the **GORM Hints** package using Go modules. The instructions ensure that the package is correctly added as a dependency for your Go project, compatible across all major platforms.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM Hints, verify you meet the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or higher
- **GORM version:** 1.24.0 or higher
- **Environment:** A working Go development environment with module support enabled

If you need help verifying your setup, refer to the [Prerequisites documentation](/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites).

<Tip>
Using Go modules is the recommended way to manage dependencies. Ensure your project has a valid `go.mod` file by running `go mod init <module-name>` if you haven't already.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing the Package

Follow these steps to add the GORM Hints package to your project using Go modules.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add the GORM Hints Module">

Open a terminal and navigate to your project root directory.

Run the following command:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/hints
```

This command downloads the latest release of the GORM Hints package and adds it to your `go.mod` dependencies.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify the Dependency">

Confirm the package is listed in your `go.mod` file by opening the file and checking for:

```go
require gorm.io/hints vX.Y.Z // indirect
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is the installed version.

</Step>
<Step title="Update Modules">

To ensure all related dependencies are properly downloaded and synchronized, run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This cleans up unused dependencies and ensures all required modules are present.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, perform a quick verification to confirm the package is ready to use.

1. In your Go source file, import the package:

```go
import "gorm.io/hints"
```

2. Run a basic build or test (e.g., `go build` or `go test`) to ensure no import errors occur.

3. Optionally, you can run a simple query with a hint clause to verify integration, such as:

```go
DB.Clauses(hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100)")).Find(&User{})
```

If the build succeeds without errors, the installation was successful.

<Note>
For detailed validation steps and troubleshooting, see the [Validating Installation guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/integration-check).
</Note>

## 4. Platform Considerations

The installation via Go modules works uniformly across Windows, macOS, and Linux provided Go is correctly installed and configured.

If you encounter platform-specific issues:

- Confirm your Go version with `go version`.
- Check if your `GOPATH` and environment variables are properly set.
- Ensure network access to `proxy.golang.org` or your custom Go module proxy to download dependencies.

<Tip>
Using a consistent Go module proxy and caching dependencies locally accelerates installation and avoids intermittent network failures.
</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps

Once the package is installed:

- Proceed to the [Configuring Your Project](/getting-started/first-steps/configuration-basics) to learn how to configure GORM Hints in your code.
- Explore the [Your First Query with Hints](/getting-started/first-steps/first-hint-query) page for step-by-step usage examples.

## Troubleshooting Installation

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">

Ensure you are running Go 1.18 or later by executing:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is older, please upgrade Go to meet the minimum requirement.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Module Not Found or Network Errors">

If `go get` fails with network errors:

- Check your internet connection.
- Confirm firewall or proxy settings allow Go module downloads.
- Try setting the environment variable `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Import Errors in Code">

If your IDE or build tool cannot resolve `gorm.io/hints`:

- Run `go mod tidy` again to fetch missing dependencies.
- Restart your IDE to refresh module cache.
- Verify your project is within a valid Go module (has `go.mod`).

</Accordion>
