# Prerequisites for Using GORM Hints

Before integrating the GORM Hints extension into your Go project, it is crucial to ensure your development environment meets all necessary requirements. Proper preparation prevents common setup issues and ensures a smooth experience when injecting SQL hints into your GORM queries.

---

## 1. Go Environment Requirements

- **Go Version:** Ensure you are running Go 1.18 or higher. GORM Hints leverages Go modules and generics features that require this minimum version.

- **Go Modules Enabled:** Your project must use Go modules (`go.mod`) for dependency management. This is standard for modern Go projects and simplifies version control of GORM and hints packages.

---

## 2. GORM Version Compatibility

- **GORM Version:** The Hints extension is designed to work with **GORM v1.24.0 or above**.

- **Import Path for GORM:** Make sure you are importing GORM with the official module path: `gorm.io/gorm`

- **Version Check:** You can verify your GORM version by inspecting your `go.mod` or by running:
  ```bash
  go list -m all | grep gorm
  ```

<Check>
Ensuring GORM is up to date avoids compatibility issues with clause modification mechanisms used by Hints.
</Check>

---

## 3. Additional Dependencies

- **Hints Package:** The Hints extension itself is imported from `gorm.io/hints`.

- This package depends on your project being set up with GORM already installed.

- The package includes support for optimizer hints, index hints, and comment hints seamlessly integrated into GORM's clause system.

---

## 4. Development Environment Setup

- **IDE or Editor:** Use an IDE with Go support (like GoLand, VSCode with Go extension) that can resolve modules and provide code completion for GORM and Hints.

- **Internet Access:** Required to fetch dependencies during `go get` or `go mod tidy`.

- **Database Access:** Although not strictly a prerequisite, having a running instance of your target SQL database (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) is recommended to test queries involving hints.

---

## 5. Network and Permission Considerations

- Ensure your development machine can access the online module proxy (e.g., `proxy.golang.org`) or your chosen source of Go modules.

- Your project should have the necessary permissions to download and install Go packages.

---

## 6. Validating Your Environment

After verifying these prerequisites, you can run a simple test to confirm that you can import GORM and the Hints extension without errors.

Example minimal test file:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "gorm.io/hints"
)

func main() {
  // Dummy usage
  hint := hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000)")
  fmt.Println(hint)
  var db *gorm.DB // assume this is properly initialized
  _ = db
}
```

Run `go build` or `go mod tidy` to verify that all imports resolve correctly.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Not Found">
Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed and your `PATH` includes the `go` binary. Run `go version` to confirm.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM Version Mismatch">
If GORM is older than v1.24.0, update it using `go get gorm.io/gorm@latest` or specify the version in `go.mod`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Module Not Found or Fails to Download">
Check your internet connectivity and proxy settings. Run `go env GOPROXY` to verify module sources.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
