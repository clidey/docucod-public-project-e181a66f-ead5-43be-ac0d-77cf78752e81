# Validating Installation

Ensure GORM Hints is properly installed and integrated into your Go project by following these straightforward verification steps. Confirming the setup early guarantees you can use hints confidently to optimize your GORM queries.

---

## 1. Verify Import and Module Installation

Confirm that the `gorm.io/hints` package is listed in your `go.mod` file and imported correctly in your Go source code.

```go
import "gorm.io/hints"
```

Run this command in your project directory to ensure dependencies are properly downloaded:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

If there are no errors, the package is installed and available for use.

---

## 2. Set Up a Dry-Run Database Connection

Use GORMâ€™s in-memory SQLite database with DryRun mode to test SQL generation without executing any queries on a real database. This is ideal for verifying SQL statements generated by GORM with hints.

```go
import (
  "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "gorm.io/hints"
)

db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open(":memory:"), &gorm.Config{DryRun: true})
if err != nil {
  panic("failed to connect database")
}
```

---

## 3. Execute a Sample Query with a Hint

Run a simple `Find` query on a sample model with and without a hint clause to observe the difference in generated SQL.

```go
type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
}

// Query without hints
result := db.Find(&User{})
println(result.Statement.SQL.String())
// Expected Output: SELECT * FROM `users`

// Query with optimizer hint
result = db.Clauses(hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100)")).Find(&User{})
println(result.Statement.SQL.String())
// Expected Output: SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100) */ * FROM `users`
```

---

## 4. Confirm Correct SQL Output

Check that the output SQL string includes the expected hints exactly as you wrote them. This confirms the hint injection mechanism is functional.

- Without the hint: Should output the standard GORM SQL statement.
- With the hint: The SQL must contain the hint comment block formatted appropriately.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Import Errors or Package Not Found">
- Ensure your Go version is 1.18 or above.
- Run `go get -u gorm.io/hints` to fetch the latest package.
- Confirm that the `go.mod` file is up to date using `go mod tidy`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="DryRun Mode Setup Fails">
- Verify your GORM version is 1.24.0 or newer, which supports DryRun mode consistently.
- Check for typos in the SQLite connection string.
- Ensure no conflicting GORM configurations exist in your setup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hint Clause Does Not Appear in Generated SQL">
- Verify you are importing and using the correct `hints` package: `gorm.io/hints`.
- Make sure you call `.Clauses(hints.New("your hint"))` before executing the query.
- Check that `DryRun` is enabled to inspect SQL without execution.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

After successful validation, proceed to:

- Explore [Your First Query with Hints](../first-steps/first-hint-query) to learn how to apply hints effectively.
- Review [Configuring Your Project](../first-steps/configuration-basics) for advanced customization.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-steps/troubleshooting) if you encounter problems.

## Example Complete Test Code Snippet

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "gorm.io/hints"
)

type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
}

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open(":memory:"), &gorm.Config{DryRun: true})
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  // Query without any hints
  result := db.Find(&User{})
  fmt.Println("Without hint:", result.Statement.SQL.String())

  // Query with a hint
  result = db.Clauses(hints.New("MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(100)")).Find(&User{})
  fmt.Println("With hint:", result.Statement.SQL.String())
}
```

Run this program. You should see the plain SELECT statement first, then the SELECT statement annotated with the optimizer hint.
